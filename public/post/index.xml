        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company I work for decided to do layoffs and fortunately I was not impacted. However, it did get me thinking on whether or not I felt ready to interview with other companies in case I had been fired. And I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t feel that ready. As such, I bought the &lt;em&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/em&gt; book and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be solving every single question that is in the book. Worst case scenario, I&amp;rsquo;ll learn some new stuff, which isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to refresh my Python knowledge, which is always nice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
